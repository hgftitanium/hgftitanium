I am [@hgftitanium](https://github.com/hgftitanium) Hilton Fernandes at Titanium Asset, a Brazilian investment fund specialized in cryptocurrencies. I'm a 
programmer developing code for several crypto-related tasks.

I'm interested in the programming languages Python, C++, C, R, and Java, as well as in some statistical techniques
applicable to the study and trading of cryptocurrencies, like linear and nonlinear regression, clustering, time series and 
machine learning.

<!---- 
I'm currently learning about the programming language JavaScript, the node.js runtime environment, and Web development in 
general, since that's what end users need these days.

I'm also learning about the trading of cryptocurrencies, and my colleagues are very good at it.

I shall be using several great FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and will try to provide some return to them, be it in 
the form of questions, answers, documentation, and pull requests.
